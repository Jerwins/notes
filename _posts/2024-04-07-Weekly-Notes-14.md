Business as usual after vacation ended on Monday. Cousin's flowering ceremony this week but unfortunately this was on the busiest day with meetings so Jebi had to go alone - good thing she had some company from relatives.

Got cold and throat pain so stayed inside most of the week. Feeling much better after today.

Finally got our car yesterday after almost 5 months of it being in garage ever since the December '23 rains. Almost forced it out after multiple calls and delays in the workshop. Headache lasted 5 months because for everything from Insurance to parts replacement, I had to follow-up every single week. Frustratingly they gave fake delivery dates for everything and could not stay true to their word. It's not fully restored but the car starts and is ok to drive. I would not recommend this car service center.

The hole you see in the plastic frame (set) on the left of the picture was also asked to replace during December but was not done.

Me and my dad cut a steel sheet and pasted with some plaster to avoid rats going inside the car. 
 
There was also water inside the headlights which we disassembled and drained (pathetic service center guy said this cannot be done). We also found a LED indicator light not working on the front. These guys couldn't change a Rs. 40 bulb in 5 months. 
  
AC panel switches and one door actuator was reported to not work. They delayed even more for these parts otherwise I'd have taken my car out last month itself when I did the test-drive after car was ready to start and drive. Got fed-up by their fake promises and finally asked for the car to be delivered. Drove back from service Center which was 21 KM from my place. Car seemed ok to drive but definitely not like before.

Unfortunately the car music system (Pioneer DMH Z5290BT) which we carefully took out before giving it to service center also did not work when we tried to put it back today ☹️. Might have short-circuited while it was on battery power under water. We have a lot of fixing to do. We are not even sure if it's worth it but yeah at least for the time being I'm going to be spending some time with dad on fixing all these.
 
We are planning to do a medium-ish distance trip soon and then give it to Maruti service center before taking it out for longer trips.
