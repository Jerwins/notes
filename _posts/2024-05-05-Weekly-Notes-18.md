This week I enquired about the rat wrap around cover that I talked about last week. Contacted them via WhatsApp and they said they'll give a sample to my address. It reached our house in one day. It has three types,

+ Ultratuff
+ Classic series (170gsm)
+ Classic series (150gsm)

They even offer you the cover for free if you tear the ultra tuff cover using your hands. Not sure how legitimate that is but it's all a sales tactic that's working out for them it seems. The blue one is terrible, rest of them are of good quality. I opted for the Ultra tuff one.

After you confirm, you have to pay advance since these are custom made, it'll take at least 4-5 days. Once it's done, you have to pay the full amount for delivery. This is for online mode. If you are already in Madurai, you can visit them in-person.

After our booking confirmation of Honda City, the Sales Agent came to our house to handover receipts and provide a doc for invoice. I asked him to bring the car to check if it fits my tight parking slot. On first look, he said it'll fit. The problem in our area is the traffic outside is fast moving and hectic so patiently parking the car is not an option. The fact that the driver did not close the OVRMs and hit his right ORVM on the way back wasn't confidence inspiring as well.

Entry point width is the problem in my spot, not the length. The middle pillar causes unnecessary problem while entering the parking area.

We bought this cute portable fan for kitchen use. Meanwhile I'm using this while using the computer most of the time.
