Rain-x rain repellant in action. Found the first con of the [rat wrap cover](https://jerwin.dev/2024/05/26/weekly-notes-21) for my car. After rains, the water goes via the zipper line and stays at the bottom. When I opened the car, a good amount of water was stagnant. Cleaned, dried the cover in the open and put it back.

We also attached the Window visors this week. It actually looks pretty good. Blended pretty well with the car color. Pictures took near my parents' house. Got some night shots too. :)

Tail lamps looks awesome at night. I like the two halogen bulbs for the number plate. Might change those to LEDs in the future.
