I'm surprised I made it this far. Some of my posts are updated as "non-published" that's why they end up late. Sometimes I don't find time to update posts on time. This was an eventful week - good and bad.

Got a gel seat cover from Amazon for my bike to help with the back ache. It did help to some extent. I wouldn't recommend to everyone. Maybe it'll be useful in long rides.

My order from Karzndolls arrived. I've started collecting hot wheels and diecast models as a hobby. Lets see how long it goes. All three of them looked great in person. Sycorax warmed me about the rabbit hole I'm getting into.

Detailing in mini-GT models are fantastic. I wish they were available in India directly instead of as imports.

Got these from Amazon. I wanted to paint my car's brake calipers to red and the alloys to full glossy black. Found a watch like that and it was on a discount. Instantly ordered and received it this week. The strap is extra long so we went out and removed some pieces to fit my hand at the nearest watch store. Super satisfied with the product. Worth it!

Got these two at Adam's shop near Velachery while we were doing wedding shopping for my sister-in-law. Not a fan of tooned versions but this is all I got.

Now for the bad part: On Sunday, I rammed the same right hand side door that was replaced recently while coming out of our tight parking space. At that time, a small truck was there unloading bricks at the front and I got startled and took a right turn coming out (not enough) and dented the entire right side door and quarter panel. I regretted getting this car that day. Terrible day. Decided to take it outside anyway and gave invitations to some relatives with a bad mood. Showed it to my dad and he was like "how did you even end up hitting this while reverse parked? coming out is the easiest part". I was sad. He was kinda disappointed and told me not to fix it.

Had lunch at parent's house and decided to park it in Metro parking. Previously there was a Rs.2000 monthly pass at Mount metro. This resulted in people thinking that it entitles them to "own" the place for a month and started fighting when the parking was crowded and when there was no place. So they cancelled this pass :(  Right now a single day costs Rs.180 which is a lot. I parked with a peace of mind after a long time compared to what we have been doing in my house parking.

Both of us were very low on energy and our moods were not great so ended up roaming around random places in bike to lighten up the mood. Got these 5 cars from Adam's @ Rs.179 MRP.

Dinner at Layalee @ Velachery. We usually go to Layalee near Jaya TV, decided to try this place near our location. Food was good. Ambience could have been better - maybe it's because we decided to stay in ground floor near the entrance. 

End of another eventful week. I don't think I'll sleep today.
