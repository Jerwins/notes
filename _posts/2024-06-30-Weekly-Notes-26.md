Wife's mom and dad were here to invite close relatives to the wedding next month. I took them to places on a Sunday and had heavy lunch. After that, we went to the beach as my sister-in-law never had a chance to ride inside the car ever since it was bought. Unfortunately, we had no parking space in the beach. Drove back and had parking issues at home too. Sigh. 

Not a memorable week.
