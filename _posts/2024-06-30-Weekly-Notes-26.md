Wife's mom and dad were here to invite close relatives to the wedding next month. We did some shopping for the bride and the groom on Saturday. If anyone decides to go to RMKV in Tnagar, know that there's no 2-wheeler parking and you should avoid parking opposite to the road. Give Rs. 50 to nearby Saravana Stores bike parking and leave it. I took them to relatives' places on a Sunday for the invites. After that, we went to the beach as my sister-in-law never had a chance to ride inside the car ever since it was bought. Unfortunately, we had no parking space in the beach and driving in traffic is a PITA. Drove back and had parking issues at home too. Sigh. 

Not a memorable week.
