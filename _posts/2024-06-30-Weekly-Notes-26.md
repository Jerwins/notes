Wife's mom and dad were here to invite close relatives to the wedding next month. We did some shopping for the bride and the groom on Saturday. If anyone decides to go to RMKV in T Nagar, know that there's no 2-wheeler parking and you should avoid parking opposite to the road. Give Rs. 50 to nearby Saravana Stores bike parking and leave it. We then had lunch at Buhari on the way back home. Bought the coats from Louis Philippe as it was conveniently near Buhari restaurant.

I took them to relatives' places on a Sunday for the invites. After that, we went to the beach as my sister-in-law never had a chance to ride inside the car ever since it was bought. Unfortunately, we had no parking space in the beach and driving in traffic is a PITA. Drove back and had parking issues at home too. Sigh.

My Honda Connect app was glitchy and started pushing delayed notifications which scared me. I had to double check and come outside to check if the engine is running or if the door is closed or not. Ever since this day, I'm also getting double entries in my trips under the app. Not sure what is going on.
