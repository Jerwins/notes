- Busy week in office with last-minute changes. I also have to make sure that I finish my work early this sprint since I'm traveling out of town for Easter next week.

- Sold my Audio Technica MSR7 which I bought in 2016. Shipped it via DTDC before reaching the office. It's a good headphone but I don't have any use for it. Someone said it's better than a M50x while I was selling it. You be the judge.

- Jebi did her magic with the food this week. (Lucky me! üòÅ)

- Our bedroom pedestal fan slowed down drastically. Removed the housing and replaced it with a ‚Çπ30 condenser. Issue resolved!

- Removed Ubuntu and I no longer dual-boot with Windows 10 since I don't use it that much after college. If I need it, I'll use a virtual box. Instead of doing it properly, I removed the partition and ran into Grub issues as usual. Created a Windows-10 USB boot drive on my old Macbook Air (which took painfully long) and fixed the bootloader issues. I realized on the way that my new Macbook M1 Air does not have USB ports and I'd have to purchase a dongle/dock for everything. ü§ï

- It's '[Palm Sunday](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palm_Sunday)' this week. We went to church in the morning and the one delivering the message convinced us to stick with the old church. It's a long story.

- After church, went to Madambakkam to attend Jebi's friend's wedding. Her old company colleagues also came for the wedding and it was good to see everyone reunited in one place.

- IPL 2024 started this week. So glad we will have entertainment till midnight every day for the next few months.

- Look who's a fan of Power Wash Simulator! First time I saw my wife play a game on PC. The next immediate thing she asked was if it's available on iPad. (unfortunately no!)

New apps to try:
- Arc Browser
- Cursor IDE
- Warp Terminal
- Zed IDE
