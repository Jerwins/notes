Well look whose back!

Got our car Monday evening as promised. Excellent work on the body shop. We were disappointed with the first service done. Not washed properly and had scratches under door handles. Interiors were dirty which we had to complain to get it cleaned. God knows if they washed the under chasis but they said they did. Overall, happy that our car is back! Drove straight to our home and parked infront before going to our congested parking lot (which we usually park after 11 PM).

After a good 20 minutes, I parked inside with the help of my wife. Parking is such a hassle - the only bad thing about this house and area.

It's been very rainy on and off in Chennai. Either it rains heavily at night time or it rains in the evening. Picture shows me being stuck in our parking shed due to rain.

We went to ibaco after an impulsive thought to eat ice cream and to bring the moods up during Friday night. It was well worth it. Stayed late Friday and Saturday to enjoy some 'me' time and to blog. We went to 'Inside out 2' which was decent. My wife loved the movie so it was worth it.

Got sun glasses for me on the way to the movie in BSR mall.

Some of my friends graduated this year (Georgia Tech) - congratulations! They sent  campus tour photos in slack.

Got the window visor that I ordered from carhatke today. Looks good quality (GFX brand). I need to find time to fit these and see if it blends with our car color. I'll post a car review soon in blog and team-bhp.
