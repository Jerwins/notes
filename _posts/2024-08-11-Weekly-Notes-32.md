Marriage week! Tension all over the place with everyone especially father-in-law.

One more car I got to drive and park inside church - Tata Tiago! 

There’s so much happening that I can’t document everything but if you have been in a marriage setting, just imagine the house in the last 2 days :)

chicken biryani for lunch on engagement day! The carrot jam/alwa was delicious.

Last minute decision to drive the bride to the mahal. Cleaned up the car and had a chat with father who bless us and the newly bought car which had all the bad luck so far. Haha

Everything went good. Me & Jebi were the best couple. One or two unexpected misses but overall everyone was relieved.

All we need is a good delicious Tea at the end of the day. Mother in law makes the best tea! (Hope my wife doesn’t see this haha)
