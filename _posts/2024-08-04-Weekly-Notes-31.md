Hope everyone is doing well. This week was mostly spent on packing for the trip to Tuticorin on Saturday. Wife wanted to fix the door before the trip and we consulted with the Honda team and they asked us to come on Monday.

We wanted it by Friday and they promised itâ€™d be ready by Thursday. They did a good job with the repair work. Took them two days for the dent and paint work.

Took an auto to LIC metro from Honda Showroom in GP road and came back to Mount metro.

Got the delivery on Friday evening after wash and wax. Thanks Honda team!

Got these for Rs.200 in a local shop since I donâ€™t have any sun film on windows or a factory fitted shades like the Kia.

Started our journey to Tuticorin for SIL marriage. Took some photos along the way. Picked up the bride along the way in Trichy. There was some news about kollidam bridge etc but google maps rerouted us and we didnâ€™t have any delays.

Peaceful parking. Sigh

Got this bad boy delivered to Tuticorin from a friend. Looks great!

Iâ€™ll be working from home applying leave on Monday and Tuesday and then off for six days. Hoping everything goes well.
