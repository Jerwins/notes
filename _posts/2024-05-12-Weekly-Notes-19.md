After much discussion on reddit, twitter and seeing posts on dashcamtalk, I decided to buy the Viofo A229 Plus Dual Channel Dashcam. The price is high but the quality and the dual Starvis 2 sensor it provides is way good. It also comes with 24x7 support via WhatsApp or call. There is an excellent video on this cam on [TravelTech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iol0SXYYWP8) if you want to check it out.

Bought the recommended max endurance card which can withstand constant read-write and has better heat control. The one thing with SandDisk cards is that there are many fakes circulating so make sure to do your own assessment. There are many videos on YouTube on how to identify a fake. Fortunately mine is genuine. Got this on an Amazon sale.

Updated front and rear cam firmware once I got the cam.

Talk to a car accessory shop for running the wires and he quoted around Rs.900 | Will probably give it to them once the car is delivered at the end of the month. I don't want to DIY this one.
