Our test drive spree continued, this week it was the Nissan Magnite Turbo. This was my wife's favorite car (exterior look). She loved the front grill. The car that was given was a white-black dual tone variant which looked stunning in the hot sun.

Our first impressions quickly changed from good to worse once we got in. Even more than me, my wife was extremely disappointed with the cabin feel, rear seat comfort and AC throw. The cooling was god awful to be honest even on the front. The drive was okay but the seating felt like I was trapped in a hole near the driver seating position. It felt like I was sitting slanted facing the windshield in a weird position. The instrument cluster had a prehistoric design which did not help one bit. Most of the cabin felt empty. 

The agent who brought the car was unenthusiastic as well. He wasn't in any way explaining the feature nor was he trying to sell the car. This was a huge disappointment considering we heard good things about the car, not so much about the service Centre. After the drive, we quickly dropped off and went back home. 

On the same time, our Honda sales agent still kept calling us for checking out Elevate colors and for pre-booking. We went there to look at colors and had no intention to book at this point. Unlike the City, Elevate was costly and lacked VFM. For example, if you compare V variant of both models, you'll see that ADAS doesn't come in Elevate while it does in City. There were so many feature misses like this. 

Posting some car colors for Elevate,

After that, since we had Grand Vitara on our consolidated list, we went to the NEXA showroom nearby to book a test drive and to check the car in-person. We were mighty impressed with the base Sigma model. 

- Keyless entry
- Auto start/stop button
- 17" wheels
- 210mm ground clearance
- Automatic AC
- DRLs
- Mild hybrid (~2/3 Kmpl difference)
- Stunning rear profile
- Comfortable seats 

Infotainment system doesn't come with this model but there is provision + 2 speakers inside if you consider in the future which is excellent. Since we had pioneer set already, I thought this was perfect. My wife also loved the design and interiors. We booked for test drive next weekend.
