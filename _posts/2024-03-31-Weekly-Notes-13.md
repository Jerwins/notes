Easter week!

We boarded Pearl City Express Tuesday night. Arrived at Tuticorin station on time early morning. Our cab was waiting to pick us up. Welcomed with gloomy weather!

My mother-in-law treated me with Tea &  poori - prawn masala. It was absolutely delicious after a tiring sleepless night on the train.

Lunch - Sambhar rice, fish fry, veggies and prawn fry. Full tummy! Got fatter with the food I ate here.

Went out that night to Sam Hotel to get some Tuticorin Parotta with my father-in-law and to buy some household items in Jeyam Super Market. Traffic is crazy as always here.

Delicious Jackfruit. 0.5 kg = ₹100

Kodukapuli (Monkey Pod) - Jebi loves to eat these. 0.25 Kg = ₹120

Stole the jackfruit from the fridge and emptied it on the night of purchase

Next day travelled 5-6 km to get Pathaneer in the morning. The board says "City people managed Pathaneer shop to raise money for improvement of education"

It's been a long time since I drank one of these. In Chennai, there are roadside shops for this on the way to my office but those are mixed with water/some other crap. I'd suggest to avoid those and get this in case you visit southern TN. Unfortunately couldn't find palm fruit (nongu) anywhere until MIL bought them during Easter on the way back from Church.

Some shopping with father-in-law. Almost all the KMs driven is by me. I clocked 210 KM at the end of the week's visit. Access 125 is in good shape!

If you visit Tuticorin, make sure to visit Gnanam Bakery - Delicious vanilla roll cakes, biscuits and macaroons. Sponge cake is so good.

Sponge cake - Vanilla roll. Ate at least 10 of these in 3 days. Also bought one more box on the last day of our stay.

Nostalgic classic candy that all South Indian parents would know (Javvu Mittai). Apparently, it's also called Bombay candy

Easter Sunday Service - We went there for the 6.30 AM service. The roads were surprisingly full of water due to rain that night. The weather here has been a mixed bag. Early morning showers and 38+C scorching sun afterward. Happy Easter!

We boarded the return train to Chennai Sunday night, watching CSK match for some time before I went to marathon "3 Body Problem" on Netflix. We plan to come here after a few months. 

Until next time!
