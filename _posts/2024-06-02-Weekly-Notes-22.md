Drove to service centre to put the steering wheel cover before we go on our long trip. The service person told us that it'll take at least 1 hour so we went to EA which is very close to this place.

Jebi helped with removing the existing fastag and we applied the one from our desired bank. This took some time. The nail polish remover came in clutch even though it took long to scrub everything. Deactivated the old fastag and transferred remaining amount.

Parking inside church - what a relief to not worry about tight parking spaces.

I don't have any food pics for this week. Here's some jackfruit madness we bought near toll along the way. Super tasty!

Got some nongu, Gnanam bakery roll cakes and bought some household items. Overall chill weekend. Planning to visit my grandma, father-in-law's brother, mother-in-law's father in Tirunelveli and my mother's sister in Uvari, next week.
