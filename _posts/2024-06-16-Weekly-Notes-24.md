Bought this rain repellant after a recommendation from our relative uncle who suggested it after watching our adventurous trip to service centre with almost zero visibility. Bought after watching some videos on rain-x products. Only thing that I'm unsure of is whether this is legitimate or not as it's imported from US. (they say)

Received an update from body shop person that the ordered car door has been received and painting stage has started. I was a little worried it would look odd compared to other doors but SA promised me it wouldn't and he sent me a photo before polish to look at the colour and paint job done. Assured me he can deliver the vehicle on Monday next week. Received an SMS and email late saturday evening that car is in 'Ready to pickup' status.

Since it's my mother's birthday weekend, me and my brother planned to go to East Coast Madras Square in ECR to have lunch one day before her birthday (since they are travelling to Bangalore on her birthday together). I missed my car during this time as it could have been so useful. Anyway, we went to the restaurant. Spent some quality time. Food was good but the wait time was a little more than normal. All went well as planned and we stayed there for the weekend.

My Mother turns 64 today. Happy birthday mom! Wishing long life and good health. Me and Jebi went to church early morning. Came back and completed the cake cutting. Said our good byes early morning and dropped dad at the metro station as he went to Madurai with his gang for his friend's function.

Wife all prepared to go tackle the sunny ride! (looking like Metal/Steel man from Terminator 2 lol)

We had planned to eat lunch at our relative's house today. So we went straight to their house via bike in hot sun. I swear to god every time I goto their house, we gain extra 5 kgs. That's how much they feed us. After all the delicious biryani's, chicken, mangoes and desserts, we drove back to our home and slept like babies.
