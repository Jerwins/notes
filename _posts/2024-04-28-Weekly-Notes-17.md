This week decided to check out a dealer of the same kind in a different location (nearer to our area) to know if the price is lower than what they quote in OMR branch. At this point we were kind of focused on getting either Elevate or a City. Finally found this color in showroom. It looked good in-person. :)

We decided that we'll either go for Meteoroid Gray or Golden Brown. Talked to the sales guy about the prices of variants, elegant edition pricing and financing options. The prices weren't that much lower than the other branch, so I wasn't really impressed with their pitch. One thing I found out during the talk is the Elegant Edition model. It's something introduced during 2023 Diwali time which gives 50k+ worth of accessories for a cheaper discount. You can find more info [here](https://www.hondacarindia.com/honda-city-5th-generation/honda-city-elegant-edition).

Key Features in Elegant Edition:
+ Elegant Edition Badge
+ Front Fender Garnish
+ Sleek Step Illumination
+ Trunk Spoiler with LED
+ Elegant Edition Seat Cover
+ Wireless Charger
+ Leg Room Lamp

Last five features are attractive and useful for the price they offered. Checked out Golden Brown in the sun as well. Looks blackish and feels hard to maintain by generally looking at it. Even minor scratches are clearly visible. The color has it's wow factor though at night.

On  the next day, a redditor in r/carsindia referred me to go check out Sundaram Honda. He suggested that they provide almost 40k-50k discount compared to the dealer I was looking at before. Took his word and talked to the Sales Manager who was very clear and explained me the options. I requested for brochure and pricing of normal + revised edition (one with 6 airbags) and the elegant edition. I even enquired about the electric variant of Honda city which is amazing but the price is just too much for the car.

Me and my wife decided to go to Nandanam branch and talk about the options available and to see the colors. Our desired colors were Meteoroid Grey and Golden Brown and we wanted to see it in-person. Sales Manager escorted us to their main branch in Thousand Lights and showed us the colors. It was a 20 minute drive.

Meteoroid grey is the car we were riding on to the main branch and we opted to sit in the rear seat to check the comfort. It kind of gives out a BMW vibe with the color and the tail light scheme similar to the 3 series. Golden brown came as a close second after staring at both the cars for a solid 20 minutes.

While the sales person suggested to book the car and the variant, we took our sweet time and booked it after a healthy discussion at home. We finally booked Honda City V-MT 2024 iVTEC Elegant Edition (Meteorid Grey). We already booked a test drive for Grand Vitara this Saturday but cancelled it once we booked the City. Finally our month long dilemma came to an end with all the research and negotiations.

Delicious mango juice after a long time!

We thought of getting a clay pot biryani on Saturday to try out how it tastes. 
**Verdict**: Waste of money. Not as expected.

And one more thing, found something very interesting in team-bhp for the rat problem in cars. I saw a cover which wraps around cars from the bottom to the top. Looks promising. The only question being rats bite through stronger materials, wondering how the cover provided holds up against that. I have enquired to them for a sample, I'll update next week.
