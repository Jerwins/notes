We decided to go to Tirunelveli to visit my grandma, grandpa and our cousin sister who recently gave birth to a beautiful baby girl. Had to drive to some places in between. Spent a lot of time in cousin sister’s place. Had lunch and spent hours discussing happy moments.

We wanted to return to Tuticorin before night time but that backfired. Ended up reaching home by 7 pm.

Returned home to Chennai. It was a slow start in the morning, both of us didn’t sleep much and I had second thoughts about leaving. There was a power cut as well from 2 am to 5 am. Everyone in the house was awake when we left the house.

Parked in mount metro until we find a better parking spot. Got to know that it’ll be free post 5-6pm.

Bike was a mess. Gave it to a nearby local water wash shop for ₹200. Guy did a good job actually cleaning it. Overall satisfied.

There’s some work going on near our turn near Mahindra showroom.

We went for a movie - Deadpool & Wolverine (IMAX) at Luxe. It was fantastic. Thoroughly enjoyed.
