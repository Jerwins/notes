**Things I like:**

+ High revving engine. Switch to second gear and drive past 100 kmph - 7000 RPM madness!
+ Steering is an absolute joy. Tuned to greatness. I'd say this is my favourite part of the car.
+ Love the suspension. It isn't too soft or too hard. 
+ Beige treatment and the overall interior feels very premium.
+ Adequate cooling provided by AC unit. Good feedback from family on rear AC vents.
+ Extremely satisfying physical buttons for infotainment, AC unit and steering wheel controls.
+ Spacious car cabin with excellent rear seat comfort.
+ Seat covers provided with the Elegant Edition model feels premium and comfortable.
+ BMW 3 series inspired tail lights are a looker.
+ 506L boot space.
+ ADAS in V variant (unlike Elevate). Adaptive cruise control in a manual car! 
+ Good underchasis protection and bonnet protection.
+ Elegant Edition perks and Honda connect app.
+ Honda's reliability and low maintenance. (WOM) Fingers crossed.

**Things I don't like:**

+ Stock factory fitted tires. V MT comes fitted with GoodYear Assurance Tripemax 2 - 185/60/R15. They are ok but not suitable for highway rides especially at high speeds.
+ Paint quality is disappointing. Am I the only one who feels the same? tiny hairline scratches everywhere are disheartening.
+ I'm not a fan of the front chrome lining. I should probably give the Honda City RS treatment after a few years.
+ ADAS is supposed to make you feel safer, not the opposite. Lane assist works but when you are trying to overtake in highway at a close range, it will push you to the other side instead (detecting lane cross over). You have to apply some force to steer to the opposite or put the indicator every single time. CMBS is turned ON after every engine restart and you constantly fear if it's going to suddenly brake and end up in a situation where vehicles rear-end you.
+ No 360 Camera. I was actually contemplating getting the VX for lanewatch alone but my friends said the camera quality isn't great and I also did not need a sunroof too. My dad just laughed when I said lanewatch comes on the left side only (for a 16L+ car you buy...)
+ No ventilated seats. Available as an accessory for 6k which disturbs the look of the interiors because it's not beige. 
+ No front parking sensors. I was told by SA that they had this but Honda removed it because too many customers started complaining that it's annoying.
+ Infotainment system looks prehistoric.
+ Honda connect app not detecting when trunk is open. If you silently rest the trunk door, the app wouldn't say it's open but the car instrument cluster will detect it's open. On the contrary - No bonnet open warning in car cluster but the app has it.
+ Beige fabric on the sides are hard to clean and gets dirty soon.
+ Should be 6-airbags standard even if it's Elegant Edition.

**Prelude**

Our family owned an Alto LXI which got submerged in [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_South_India_floods) floods. My dad sold that to dealer out of frustration with insurance agent and mental harassment from dealership, and got us a new car. I don't know if this dealer still exists for Maruti but it's the most fraudulent dealer we encountered.

Fast forward few months later we got a new Swift ZXI Top model Petrol in Jan 2016. It has been through some tough times. A reliable 4 cylinder machine. We usually take our car for highway trips with family until it almost faced the same fate. Ran more than 65,000 KMs. Got flooded in [2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Michaung) floods. Repaired it with insurance and own money. Got it back to working condition but we decided to sell it later for various reasons. Sold the car in good running condition. 

Me and my wife started looking for cars to fill the void. We thought of getting an SUV keeping the ground clearance in mind and the high seating point for parents. We also wanted something that lasts for at least 10 years with a decent maintenance record. So we started calling Hyundai, Maruti, Nissan and Honda for test drive appointments. The most receptive was Honda. Hyundai took ages to contact us back but called continuously afterwards. Nissan representative didn't care if I buy or not. Maruti representative kept routing calls to other branches until we went straight to the branch itself to talk. Honda was the only brand that valued my request and continuously followed up over call.

Honda Elevate MT - I'm not going to pretend I'm a car enthusiast here. This was my first time driving a SUV and my first on a Honda. I had clear view of the bonnet. The suspension felt like I was on a boat or a VOLVO bus. I had a tiny feel of nausea due to the suspension but I actually enjoyed driving the car. It was different.

 WSL - 3.75/5

![](https://i.imgur.com/WnU6PsY.jpg)

Honda City MT - On the same day, we requested for a test drive of City MT, as my wife wanted to see how the face-lifted sedan felt like. This time it felt a lot easier to drive and it was like I drove this car before already. Steering was so loose and fluid that I thought at one point there was some defect with the car. It felt peppy and the rev-sound was amazing. I loved it. (I later found out that this was my wife's dream car when she was a child) BTW our focus was on SUV, so we didn’t consider this seriously even after driving and loving it.

WSL - Wife's full teeth / 5

Nissan Magnite Turbo MT - This was my wife's favorite car when it comes to exterior looks (especially the grill). She was mighty impressed with the demo car exterior look too. All the excitement disappeared once we entered the vehicle. AC throw wasn't good enough. Instrument cluster from the 1990s. My seating position felt like I was trapped in a slanted bowl inside the car. My wife was literally sweating on the back with sub-par comforting seats. The representative absolutely did not care whether I buy or not. He did not even make an attempt at marketing this car. Our short ride ended and my wife was very disappointed.

WSL - 0/5

Grand Vitara Smart Hybrid Sigma model - We loved this car. Jesus Christ! this thing had to be the most VFM variant in GV. It surprisingly had more features for a base model. The sales person was very knowledgeable and explained each and everything clearly. Cleared all my doubts. 30k exchange bonus was enticing. The choice became easier when we realised this doesn’t come with an infotainment system (we had a spare Pioneer 5290BT which we bought for SWIFT) but had a provision for a system with two speakers already fitted (if I remember correctly). Everything about this car felt amazing….Until our friends got involved lol. XL6 and GV owners started messaging about battery drain, replacement costs, warranty woes and started scaring us about battery concerns. We had to take a step back and contemplate if we need a smart hybrid car. (And would it last for at least 10 years hassle free?) That path lead to us dropping plans but this car definitely stays in my heart.

WSL- 4.8/5

Hyundai Creta - We dropped this due to high cost and lower variants did not seem value for money. SX Tech and top end model looked good but to be honest, I never liked Creta. Front grill looked odd. Back looks sexy. I have experienced a lot of bad creta drivers on the highway that I grew a deep distaste for this car. No offence to good owners.

WSL - 2/5

Other cars that I wish I researched and driven:

Hyundai Venue
Kia Carens
Skoda Kushaq 
Dual tone Brezza

**Decision**:

We almost went with Honda Elevate at first. Talked to SA and requested for another test drive. Told him we needed to see colors in person, so drove to the showroom and saw them. We were not really satisfied with the color schemes. Our budget was 15L, and this car came close to 20L. We could have easily bought it but we always took one or two days to decide sensibly as all the sales people try their FOMO tactics. Capital Honda wasn’t giving us discounts either as we were keen on getting revised edition (6 airbags standard). At this point, we wanted to try another dealer. One point about the dealer was that they were prompt in replying and follow-ups (almost to the point of desperation). Even parked inside my shed to see if it fits. 

A friend of mine recommended to pay a visit to Sundaram Honda. While talking to the Sales Manager, we got to know about an Elegant Edition model in Honda City. It’s the V-MT with good amount of accessories at a cheaper cost. The value was good and our focus quickly shifted to buying a Sedan. Got very good discounts. Negotiated more and clarified all doubts. Booked the car in April. March month VIN. SM mentioned about 5 day wait time as vehicle is transported from Rajasthan. We postponed the date as dad was out of town and so we got the car a month later. 

**Color choice**:

Golden brown and Meteoroid Grey - We were torn between these two colours. We wanted to see both in-person. At the Sundaram Honda sales branch there was only meteoroid grey. SA took us in that car and offered to drive to Anna Salai showroom to showcase brown color. I refused to drive as 1) I already did take a test drive 2) I wanted to experience the rear seat comfort with wife. We reached the destination and took a solid 20 minutes to decide between the colors. Grey was giving BMW vibes with a tint of blue and with that spoiler it looked awesome. Wife agreed and our car search ended there. 

While I was there, I looked at the eHEV model of Honda City. Absolute monster of a car. Too bad it’s ridiculously priced. There was a 10 lac difference between V MT and eHEV. Even if it was near 20L, I would have bought it 100%. 26+ Lacs for this car is unbelievable. 


**Delivery**:

Took delivery of the car late May after confirmation of invoice and payment. I asked for steering wheel cover which they promptly forgot and said it’s out of stock. They did not force me to buy anything or offered to look at accessories. I would have bought something if they showed me a list. I later found out that they don’t have any accessories readily available. Registration was completed for the Honda Connect app during delivery. Got all the documents with a coffee and water bottle. A survey was given for rating the sales experience. We visited the showroom only once for colour selection, other than that everything was done at home. 

Overall delivery experience was mediocre. They take a photo and give it to you in a frame before you leave. There was another car waiting for delivery so all seemed a little rushed. Honda needs to improve on the delivery experience. My bike delivery was more exciting than this. Wife laughed and felt the same.

Rear seat comfort is one of the main highlights of this car. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/GUvRdp1.jpg)

The seat cover that comes with the Elegant Edition feels luxurious but I have to change it to black at some point since even a tiny dust mark looks big with this beige color. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/eRHH6VQ.jpg)

ORVM adjustment buttons and power window controls. Again the beige fabric accumulates dust and I'm finding it very hard to clean.

Asked the dealership to check if it fits in my parking. The driver rammed the ORVM at the gate (did not close) when he came backwards. It was not confidence inspiring. lol

Mileage on a recent trip to Tuticorin. It's close to 1700 KMs now and first service is complete. 


Note: Honda dealership exchange quoted way less - more than 1 Lakh less to be exact. Even with exchange discount, it was not worth it.
