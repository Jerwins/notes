**Things I like:**

+ High revving engine. Switch to second gear and drive past 100 kmph - 7000 RPM madness!
+ Steering is an absolute joy. Tuned to greatness. I'd say this is my favorite part of the car.
+ Love the suspension. It isn't too soft or too hard. 
+ Beige treatment and the overall interior feels very premium.
+ Adequate cooling provided by AC unit. Good feedback from family on rear AC vents.
+ Extremely satisfying physical buttons for infotainment, AC unit and steering wheel controls.
+ Spacious car cabin with excellent rear seat comfort.
+ Seat covers provided with the Elegant Edition model feels premium and comfortable.
+ BMW 3 series inspired tail lights are a looker.
+ 506L boot space.
+ ADAS in V variant (unlike Elevate). Adaptive cruise control in a manual car! 
+ Good underchasis protection and bonnet protection.
+ Elegant Edition perks and Honda connect app.
+ Honda's reliability and low maintenance. (WOM) Fingers crossed.

**Things I don't like:**

+ Stock factory fitted tires. V MT comes fitted with GoodYear Assurance Tripemax 2 - 185/60/R15. They are ok but not suitable for highway rides especially at high speeds.
+ Paint quality is disappointing. Am I the only one who feels the same? tiny hairline scratches everywhere are disheartening.
+ I'm not a fan of the front chrome lining. I should probably give the Honda City RS treatment after a few years.
+ ADAS is supposed to make you feel safer, not the opposite. Lane assist works but when you are trying to overtake in highway at a close range, it will push you to the other side instead (detecting lane cross over). You have to apply some force to steer to the opposite or put the indicator every single time. CMBS is turned ON after every engine restart and you constantly fear if it's going to suddenly brake and end up in a situation where vehicles rear-end you.
+ No 360 Camera. I was actually contemplating getting the VX for lanewatch alone but my friends said the camera quality isn't great and I also did not need a sunroof too. My dad just laughed when I said lanewatch comes on the left side only (for a 16L+ car you buy...)
+ No ventilated seats. Available as an accessory for 6k which disturbs the look of the interiors because it's not beige. 
+ No front parking sensors. I was told by SA that they had this but Honda removed it because too many customers started complaining that it's annoying.
+ Infotainment system looks prehistoric.
+ Honda connect app not detecting when trunk is open. If you silently rest the trunk door, the app wouldn't say it's open but the car instrument cluster will detect it's open. On the contrary - No bonnet open warning in car cluster but the app has it.
+ Beige fabric on the sides are hard to clean and gets dirty soon.
+ Should be 6-airbags standard even if it's Elegant Edition.

**Prelude**

Our family owned an Alto LXI which got submerged in [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_South_India_floods) floods. My dad sold that to dealer out of frustration with insurance agent and mental harassment from dealership, and got us a new car. I don't know if this dealer still exists for Maruti but it's the most fraudulent dealer we encountered.

![](https://i.imgur.com/e1VGXCI.jpg)

Fast forward few months later we got a new Swift ZXI Top model Petrol in Jan 2016. It has been through some tough times. A reliable 4 cylinder machine. We usually take our car for highway trips with family until it almost faced the same fate. Ran more than 65,000 KMs. Got flooded in [2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Michaung) floods. Repaired it with insurance and own money. Got it back to working condition but we decided to sell it later for various reasons. Sold the car in good running condition. 

Me and my wife started looking for cars to fill the void. We thought of getting an SUV keeping the ground clearance in mind and the high seating point for parents. We also wanted something that lasts for at least 10 years with a decent maintenance record. So we started calling Hyundai, Maruti, Nissan and Honda for test drive appointments. The most receptive was Honda. Hyundai took ages to contact us back but called continuously afterwards. Nissan representative didn't care if I buy or not. Maruti representative kept routing calls to other branches until we went straight to the branch itself to talk. Honda was the only brand that valued my request and continuously followed up over call. 

*WAR - Wife's Approval Rating

![](https://i.imgur.com/vNjSEUk.jpg)

Honda Elevate MT - I'm not going to pretend that I'm a car enthusiast here. This was my first time driving a SUV and my first on a Honda. I had clear view of the bonnet. The suspension felt like I was on a boat or a VOLVO bus. I had a tiny feel of nausea due to the suspension but I actually enjoyed driving the car. It was different.

 WAR - 3.75/5

![](https://i.imgur.com/WnU6PsY.jpg)

Honda City MT - On the same day, we requested for a test drive of City MT, as my wife wanted to see how the face-lifted sedan felt like. This time it felt a lot easier to drive and it was like I drove this car before already. Steering was so loose and fluid that I thought at one point there was some defect with the car. It felt peppy and the rev-sound was amazing. I loved it. (I later found out that this was my wife's dream car) BTW our focus was on SUV, so we didn’t consider this seriously even after driving and loving it.

WSL - Wife's full teeth / 5

![](https://i.imgur.com/JZFnClt.jpg)

Nissan Magnite Turbo MT - This was one of my wife's favorite cars when it comes to exterior look (especially the grill). She was mighty impressed with dual tone demo car that was sent to us. All the excitement disappeared once we entered the vehicle. AC throw wasn't good enough. Instrument cluster from the 1990s. My seating position felt like I was trapped in a slanted bowl inside the car. My wife was literally sweating on the back with sub-par seats. The representative absolutely did not care whether I buy or not. He did not even make an attempt to market this car. Our short ride ended and my wife was very very disappointed.

WSL - 1/5

![](https://i.imgur.com/5OI5dp9.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/9dBuHOz.jpg)

Grand Vitara Smart Hybrid Sigma model - We loved this car. Jesus Christ! this thing had to be the most VFM base variant in GV. It surprisingly had more features for a base model. 

- DRLs
- 17” wheels
- Keyless entry
- Sliding Armrest
- Stunning rear profile
- Auto start/stop button
- Tilt & telescopic steering
- 210mm ground clearance
- Automatic AC Climate Control
- Mild hybrid (~2/3 Kmpl difference)

The sales person was very knowledgeable and explained each and everything clearly. Cleared all my doubts. 30k exchange bonus was enticing. The choice became easier when we realized this doesn’t come with an infotainment system (we had a spare Pioneer 5290BT which we bought for SWIFT) but had a provision for a system with two speakers already fitted (if I remember correctly). Everything about this car felt amazing….Until our friends got involved lol. XL6 and GV owners started messaging about battery drain, replacement costs, warranty woes and started scaring us about battery concerns. We had to take a step back and contemplate if we need a smart hybrid car (And would it last for at least 10 years hassle free?). That path lead to us dropping plans but this car definitely stays in my heart.

WSL- 4.8/5

Hyundai Creta - We dropped this due to high cost and lower variants did not seem value for money. SX Tech and nLine models looked good but to be honest, I never liked Creta. Front grill looked odd. Back looks sexy. I have experienced a lot of bad Creta drivers on the highway that I grew a deep distaste for this car. No offence to good owners.

WSL - 2/5

Other cars that I wish I researched more:

- Hyundai Venue
- Kia Carens
- Dual tone Brezza

**Decision**:

We almost went with Honda Elevate at first. Talked to SA and requested for another test drive. Told him we needed to see colors in person, so drove to the showroom and saw them. We were not really satisfied with the available color schemes. Our budget was 15L, and this car came close to 20L. We could have easily bought it but we always took one or two days to decide sensibly as all the sales people try their FOMO tactics. Capital Honda wasn’t giving us discounts either as we were keen on getting revised edition (6 airbags standard). At this point, we wanted to try another dealer. I have to say the dealer was were prompt in replying and followed-up regularly (almost to the point of desperation). Even offered to park the demo car inside my narrow parking slot to see if it fits. 

A friend of mine recommended to pay a visit to Sundaram Honda. While talking to the Sales Manager, we got to know about an Elegant Edition model in Honda City. It’s the V-MT with good amount of accessories at a cheaper cost that was introduced during 2023 Diwali. The value was good and our focus slightly shifted towards buying a sedan. Negotiated and got very good discounts. They were very patient in clearing all my doubts. Booked the car in April. Got a March month VIN. Sale's manager mentioned about 5 day wait time as vehicle is transported from Rajasthan. We postponed the date as dad was out of town and so we got the car a month later. I requested for PDI which they didn't mind but I cancelled it as it was too far away from town and I trusted the sale's manager's word. I'd always recommend to do PDI before purchase.

**Color choice**:

Golden brown and Meteoroid Grey - We were torn between these two colors. We wanted to see both in-person. At the Sundaram Honda sales branch there was only meteoroid grey. SA took us in that car and offered to drive to Anna Salai showroom to showcase brown color. He requested me to drive but I refused as 1) I already did took a test drive with Capital Honda and 2) I wanted to experience the rear seat comfort of the car (major plus). We reached the destination and took a solid 20 minutes to decide between the colors. Grey was giving BMW vibes with a tint of blue and with that spoiler it looked awesome. Wife agreed and our car search ended there.

While I was there, I looked at the eHEV model of Honda City. Elegance and beautiful engineering! Too bad it’s ridiculously priced. There was a 10 lac difference between V MT and eHEV. Even if it was near 20L, I would have bought it 100%. 26+ Lacs for this car is outrageous pricing. 

**Delivery**:

Took delivery of the car late May after confirmation of invoice and payment. I asked for steering wheel cover which they promptly forgot and said it’s out of stock. They promised they'll fit it during first service or whenever I come for a mall visit (EA is nearby). They did not force me to buy anything or offered to look at accessories. I would have bought something if they showed me a list. I later found out that they don’t have any accessories readily available. Registration was completed for the Honda Connect app during delivery. Got all the documents with a coffee and water bottle. A survey was given for rating the sales experience. We visited the showroom only once for color selection, other than that everything was done at home. 

Overall delivery experience was mediocre. They take a photo and give it to you in a frame before you leave. There was another car waiting for delivery so all seemed a little rushed. Honda needs to improve on the delivery experience. My bike delivery was more exciting than this. Wife laughed and felt the same.

Exterior:

![](https://i.imgur.com/HTU5nlq.jpg)

Hood open clip situated almost at the centre, right above the Honda logo. All physical and neat surrounding finish. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/hO4ateE.jpg)

Good interior bonnet protection. SA recommend that I don't push the bonnet with my palm instead drop it from a decent elevation. He said he has seen many dented bonnets on day 1 when customers press or sit on it to close.

1.5L i-VTEC Engine

![](https://i.imgur.com/bg7rwjK.jpg)
Front Fender Garnish that comes with Elegant Edition. Blends well and looks good even though I don't like having chrome in our car.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lwFntGd.jpg)
Easily scratchable/prone door handles with sensors. It also allows for key insert for open and close. I received my car with even more scratches after giving it service people at Sundaram Honda. Faceplam!

![](https://i.imgur.com/4EYpOqz.jpg)
Tail lamps are beautiful - Thanks BM....Honda. You can see the Elegant Edition badging. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/hB0iRiw.jpg)
Stock Good Year Assurance Triplemax 2 - 180/60/R15 84H. It doesn't come with a TPMS system. I have plugged in a nexdigitron Bluetooth valve plugs for TPMS.

![](https://i.imgur.com/N514geb.jpg)
The exhaust. I should really go do a full underchasis rubberized paint work from 3M. I enquired the shop and they said it costs Rs. 5100 (5 years - every 6 months free repaint interval). Asked the same to dealership and they told me it'll cost 6k+ (one time only). wtf?

![](https://i.imgur.com/N8wLGTL.jpg)
Good to see some factory underbody protection that is already present. 

Interior:
![](https://i.imgur.com/zX6OO7Z.jpg)
Dome lights on the rear. Halogen light with a satisfying physical button and decent throw at night. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/Af4WF5M.jpg)
Middle arm rest. Good finish with the elegant edition fabric but it does not slide back n forth. I feel the position is a little odd. It should have been a little up further. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/zRzTFPB.jpg)
Traction control (long press) and headlight leveler buttons. I believe the surrounding boxes (3) are additional switch slots that I can utilize.

![](https://i.imgur.com/j2HCG6o.jpg)
Fuel cap and bonnet release levers. Feels plasticky. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/pNy7WFa.jpg)
Driver seat height adjustable lever. I'm 5'11'', I can see the bonnet from inside with highest position. I thought City's seating would be a lot lower but it's not, which is a good thing for me.

![](https://i.imgur.com/aiAjLQ4.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/VNMiPOZ.jpg)
Wireless charger that comes with Elegant Edition. Fits in the cup holders. This charger occupies the 12V socket. I had to plug my dashcam USB to the first socket. TPMS bought separately from nextdigitron. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/8o61JXK.jpg)
Side seat pocket storage - Enough space to keep your phones and purses here. Honda key cover bought from Amazon.

![](https://i.imgur.com/BW7gPX2.jpg)
I really like the gear knob and the leather finish. Coming from a SWIFT everything was an upgrade for me. My brother said it wasn't smooth like the Verna 1.6 knob.

![](https://i.imgur.com/TCPuftk.jpg)
![](https://i.imgur.com/IimX8lp.jpg)
Driver, passenger and rear foot lamps that comes with Elegant Edition. GFX premium mats bought from Carhatke (Rs. 3699). Very premium quality. Thanks for the recommendation Team-bhp!

![](https://i.imgur.com/Dbfnrod.jpg)

GFX Trunk tray from Zapcart (Rs. 1800). While shipping was horrible, my tray survived. I did not buy the basic kit from the dealership as I did not see value in those for Rs.9999

![](https://i.imgur.com/GKu97n1.jpg)
Headlight controls. Defaulted to Auto. It gets a bit annoying when you don't have any control to turn them off manually. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/UQCtYhQ.jpg)
Music controls, voice assistant and that satisfying instrument cluster scroll-wheel control button. Steering wheel cover wasn't the best. I was expecting the top model cover as it was mentioned in the brochure for accessories instead I get this cheap cover sold for Rs. 1500. Accessory guy's explanation was that it is not possible to put top model cover as it's machine cut and comes factory fitted.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fO4lh7x.jpg)
AC physical knobs are the best. Cooling is very sufficient. You have options to turn on/off/circulate air/max cool and defogger options.

![](https://i.imgur.com/RN5CBaF.jpg)
Adaptive cruise control and other ADAS control buttons. Tried it during the my trip to Tuticorin and felt it was programmed well. Adaptive CC on a manual car is great at this price point. Lane keep assist (works above 70 kmph) got annoying real fast in highway when I had to put much effort into steering left when the system steered me right as I was crossing the line. I have to put the indicator every time to avoid the car from doing that in the name of safety. There is also CMBS (Collision Mitigation Braking System) which brakes and shuts the engine when there's a close encounter. It will brake after giving warnings and if you don't keep pressure on the brake pedal after multiple warnings, you are in for some rear end action.

![](https://i.imgur.com/dFziZFX.jpg)
Infotainment system looks ancient. Touch screen is responsive but with Honda, the features are non-existent. The car really deserves a better system, front parking sensors, 360 camera and better speakers. I haven't had issues connecting to Apple carplay. At first we had difficulty knowing how to connect after that it became a breeze. (click the button above the radio)

![](https://i.imgur.com/RMn2sia.jpg)
Wiper controls. I haven't seen these many speed controls for a wiper to be honest. At high it almost feels scary. I don't know what wiper fluid they poured but I ruined it by pouring water and my factory hydrophobic coating did not last long.

![](https://i.imgur.com/96JK58B.jpg)
I like the chrome finish around the AC vents. Sleek finish and good air circulation. Received good feedback from rear passengers too. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/XACjl7M.jpg)
Rear view mirror with manual dimmer. Attached blind spot mirrors to both the side mirrors for some more visibility coverage. Replaced stock dealership tie-up (Equitas) fastag with the ICICI one. Removed it using nail polish remover. Big thanks to my wife.

![](https://i.imgur.com/GUvRdp1.jpg)
The seat cover that comes with the Elegant Edition feels luxurious but I have to change it to black at some point since even a tiny dust mark looks big with this beige color. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/KUxsTWk.jpg)
Seat belts and head-rest (not adjustable) for every body! Rear seat comfort is one of the main highlights of this car. My family felt very comfortable. One irk with the Elegant Edition cover is the middle seat cover doesn't blend well when I open it and pull in the arm rest. I cannot hide the cover properly. It looks odd with the already odd looking arm rest that touches the middle seat when pulled.

![](https://i.imgur.com/eRHH6VQ.jpg)
ORVM adjustment buttons and power window controls. Driver seat window is one touch up/down. Rest of the windows need to be held. Beige fabric accumulates dust fast and I'm finding it very hard to clean. ( I don't know what to apply T_T )


Incident:

We took a 600 KM trip to Tuticorin from Chennai and visited my in-laws. Not even one close call happened. We decided to go down south the next day, to visit another family. Our car was slowing going at 20 kmph on traffic and all of a sudden a biker with multiple 25kg ricebags on top of tank rammed into our car on the rear side door and dented it upon seeing a police officer. The police officer laughed and went off. I called people at Honda at 9 AM even though their work starts at 10 am. They were responsive and I sent pictures to the body shop crew. They told it should cost about 8-9k (part). With labor it costed more but it was covered under insurance. 
![](https://i.imgur.com/kRYDAH7.jpg)
The guy cried and gave Rs.1500 as he did not have money. He left the spot without balance with his ricebags. My wife did not feel right getting money from the guy and refunded after an hour of discussion. Not even 10 days old. Dented and scratched. At that point, I was frustrated and did not care anymore. Wife calmed me down and said it can replaced and it was an uncontrollable incident.

Replaced door - I believe the body shop did a pretty good job with the paint work.

I couldn't find a difference. Good as new! :)

Pic from first day. Our parking spot is very tight, especially going through the gate. We managed to park it without any scratches or dents. 

Accessories that I bought outside:
![](https://i.imgur.com/qQ7HheQ.jpg)
Window Visor with chrome line from Galio brand (Rs. 1500 from Carhatke)

![](https://i.imgur.com/WoCRcq1.jpg)
Car with the rat cover for Honda City (Rs. 8500). At first it was an hassle but I think now it's a bit better.  Still need my wife to put the top cover. Entire thing weights 8.9 Kilos.

![](https://i.imgur.com/SrgWxyC.jpg)
Door handle scratches. Bought a scratch guard from Galio but I haven't applied yet because it looks out of place actually. (Not in pic)

![](https://i.imgur.com/WDQtQ7Q.jpg)
Rain-x Rain Repellant. I was told this was useful. I definitely need this for the upcoming winter.

Asked the dealership to check if it fits in my parking. The driver rammed the ORVM at the gate (did not close) when he came backwards. It was not confidence inspiring. lol

Mileage on a recent trip to Tuticorin. It's close to 1700 KMs now and first service is complete. 


Note: Honda dealership exchange quoted way less - more than 1 Lakh less to be exact. Even with exchange discount, it was not worth it.
