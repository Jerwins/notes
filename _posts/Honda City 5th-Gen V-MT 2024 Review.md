Most depressing tyres in the world. Good Year Assurance Tripemax 2 - 180/60/R15 84H. Puny tyres for this lengthy car.

Enough space to keep your phones and purses here.

I really like the gear knob and the leather finish.

Rear AC vents with Rear foot lamps. GFX premium mats (awesome quality) on display.

GFX Trunk tray. I did not buy the basic kit from the dealership as I did not see value in those for Rs.9999

Lamp controls

Music controls, voice assistant and instrument cluster scroll-wheel control button

AC physical knobs are the best. Cooling is very sufficient.

Adaptive cruise control and other ADAS control buttons

Infotainment system

I like the chrome finish around the AC vents.

Rear view mirror with a manual dimmer.

Rear seat comfort is one of the main highlights of this car. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/GUvRdp1.jpg)

The seat cover that comes with the Elegant Edition feels luxurious but I have to change it to black at some point since even a tiny dust mark looks big with this beige color. 

![](https://i.imgur.com/eRHH6VQ.jpg)

ORVM adjustment buttons and power window controls. Again the beige fabric accumulates dust and I'm finding it very hard to clean.

Asked the dealership to check if it fits in my parking. The driver rammed the ORVM at the gate (did not close) when he came backwards. It was not confidence inspiring. lol

Our Alto LXI which got submerged in [2015](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2015_South_India_floods) floods. My dad sold that to dealer out of frustration with insurance and mental harrasment from dealership and insurance, and got us a new SWIFT. I don't know if this dealer still exists for Maruti but it's the most fraudulent dealer we encountered so far. That's another story.

Fast forward few months later we got a discounted Swift (2015) Top model Petrol in Jan 2016. It was brilliant until it almost faced the same fate. Got flooded in [2023](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclone_Michaung) floods. Repaired it with insurance and own money. Got it back to working condition but we decided to sell it later for various reasons. Sold the car in good running condition. Dealership exchange quoted way less - more than 1 Lakh less to be exact.

Mileage on a recent trip to Tuticorin. It's close to 1700 KMs now and first service is complete.
