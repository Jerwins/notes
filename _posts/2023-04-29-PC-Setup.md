### Processor & Motherboard

![i9 9900k](https://i.imgur.com/30A8rXL.jpg)

I bought the i5 9600k initially from Delta Peripherals. Then had 24 hours to think through my decision üòÖ Decided to go with the 9900k convincing myself with some stupid logic that I would need this much compute at that time. So I called Delta Peripherals and asked if I could come and swap the unopened 9600k for i9 9900k and they were more than happy to accept it. (why wouldn't they? haha). The motherboard is a Gigabyte Z390 which is updated to the latest firmware and works brilliantly to date.

Bought a liquid cooler from Erodov (RIP) forums for the processor as it's known to heat quite a lot.

### GPU

2003: I was lucky to get a graphics card from my dad (he's awesome!) back in my school days. My first graphics card was an XFX Geforce FX 5200. I still remember how excited I was when we set it up and played Prince of Persia - Sands of Time. I still remember so many details from the purchase day. From me and my dad boarding a bus to Ritchie Street - me wondering if it would work with my Celeron system on the way back - holding onto the box tightly from imaginary graphics card thieves to finally fitting it in our PC.

2009: I sold the card during my college days and upgraded this to a Geforce GTX 260 (216 cores) from Palit. I remember we went there to get the same brand (XFX) but ended up buying this unknown company during that time. My dad had a colleague who sold PC parts during those years.

My first impression of the card was that it was huge, especially coming from a FX card. I wasn't as excited as getting my first card. 

2015: I never sold my GTX 260. To this day (2024), it lives in my house collecting dust. I'm not even sure it will work now. 

I saved some cash for an upgrade and at this stage of my life, I working at my second job. So asked my dad one day if I could buy a new one as it was very slow when I was more adventurous towards UI designing. I wasn't even sure if I was bottlenecked by my Core2Duo or my Graphics at that time. haha

![GTX 970](https://i.imgur.com/YjFod2q.jpg)

I got an Asus GTX 970 (from Amazon ~27k) along with an Intel Quad Core processor from some other place + SSD. I saw a substantial jump in performance. GTX 970 was VFM and it was a beast!

2019 - Present: Sold my CPU + Mobo + RAM combo in techenclave. I'm not sure where I sold my GTX 970 but I remember I let it go before Covid and at that time I saw graphics card hoarding by Bitcoin people and these things were selling for 30-40k.

This year I bought a brand new RMA'd EVGA GTX 1080 Ti from a Reddit user from Thailand who was mass-selling it for cheap (or so I thought). He had a lot of reputation and stayed legit. Bought it for $519 including shipping. Received the card brand new in a box and ended up paying an additional $200 as customs duty to DHL. This card is what I use to this day and it's absolutely value for money and runs every game I throw at it. I'd say well worth the money.

### RAM 

![RAM](https://i.imgur.com/wOpA0sp.jpg)

I had 16 GB RAM from Corsair in 2019. My brother for some reason gifted me 2 x 32 GB of RAM (with Diwali lights). So now I have 80 Gigs of RAM running at 3000 Mhz. It is still useful as my wife uses it for CAD designs and I occasionally play with LLMs.

### PSU

2019: I had bought a Rosewill 1000W Gold for 4k. I know it was cheap for a 1000W PSU but the catch was that it doesn't have any warranty. The seller wanted to clear inventory by selling them for cheap in TechEnclave. I got one and it lasted for only 3 years. PSU failures are a PITA and this one bit the dust and had me questioning whether the newly added RAM was the problem.

2022 - Present: After some good discussion with my friend Abhay, placed an order for Adata XPG Core Reactor 850W and got it fast via MDComputers in excellent packaging. This PSU was also on some high-tier PSU list so I was confident this would be a good purchase.

### Keyboard, Mice and Mic

![FC660C](https://i.imgur.com/AdvnwrN.jpg)

I was in a dilemma between FC660 and HHKB but ended up buying the FC600C from a European site which I can't remember. Using this to date and I don't miss the extended keyboard anymore.  

![Q2U Mic & Hyperx Alloy FPS](https://i.imgur.com/2aIqklu.jpg)

Had a Hyperx Alloy FPS keyboard which started double-keying strokes and ended up unusable. Samson Q2U microphone is the best mic I bought. I cannot say I have used it much though.

![Junk XM1](https://i.imgur.com/tnrLv4o.jpg)

![Scrap XM1](https://i.imgur.com/Qxz7znN.jpg)

My biggest regret in this setup is the purchase of the Endgame Gear XM1. Poor support from the company and no replacement was given for the double-clicking issue. I used this to complete an exam for Georgia Tech in one semester during COVID-19 days and I almost closed the exam tab in Chrome. I would have gotten a 0 in my exam because of this crappy product.

### Webcam

I had a Logitech 720p webcam which worked right but needed a new one because my exam rules required a cam with a wide-angle view or a clearer view (at least HD). I sold this on TechEnclave and the listing did not even last an hour IIRC. This was during Covid time and it sold in a minute. Some people were selling this for 2x but I listed it with the purchased price.

![Logitech 720p Cam](https://i.imgur.com/iYe5kVv.jpg)

So after searching through what felt like a million sites, I finally purchased Logitech C930e from a wholesaler who had a broken website which was good for nothing. Placed an order for C920 and later got a support call saying that it was a dummy listing and they had C930e for +Rs. 600, so paid the difference and waited for it to arrive before the exam.

It arrived after my exam. üôÇ‚Äç‚ÜîÔ∏è

### Audio Gear

![Galaxy Buds+](https://i.imgur.com/qNm8JSn.jpg)

Absolute beast. Value for money. Bought this 4 years ago and the quality was excellent. Wear and tear crept up this year and the plastic housing started to break. It still works but the battery isn't as good as it used to be. 

![Fiio FH9](https://i.imgur.com/zcl03hC.jpg)

Got this thing. It's great but doesn't give you the comfort of a wireless unit. High-quality IEM but I'm not an audiophile and I'm not going to pretend to be one. This does the job.

I used to have a Sony WH-1000XM2. Gave this to my father-in-law as he likes bassy headphones. üòÅ 

That's all for now. bye!
