Started our car after a week. Cleaned some dirt. Drained some water. Replaced halogen bulbs with LED T10s for map and ceiling lights. Overall it was a simple procedure. Everything is detailed nicely in the manual too. Our rat cover is working great so far, thankfully.

Wife came back to Chennai on Thursday. I went to mambalam railway station to pick her up. She also had an interview on the same day scheduled at 10.30 am. Driving from home to purasawalkam on a weekday at 9 am couldn’t be any worse. The traffic was horrible but we made it there at 10.20 am just in time. (1 hr 15 min travel time) wondering how she could have reached by auto as it was her initial plan haha. Another alternative is to take the metro from St. Thomas Mount to Egmore and take an auto to the interview place.

I went back to Virugambakkam as I was bored and waited for her interview to get over. Got a call from Jebi that she’ll return back to parents house and we can go from there to home. Might look to stay in a new house with a better parking and to take care of parents. Both of us were dead tired when we reached back home. We found this shop “Sizzling Curries - The Kolumbu Kadai” on Swiggy where we tried some chicken kolumbu and thoku. It felt like home made food. Both of us liked it and ate it with the rice boiled at home.

Saturday homemade food by Jebi. I was in a sleep-coma almost when I woke up at 1.30 pm. I don’t know what happened but I slept like a dog. Wife is down with cold and a bit of fever so bought some pills and food. We had plans to goto relatives and parents house but looks like that’s probably not going to happen. Hoping she feels better and looking forward to the new week!
