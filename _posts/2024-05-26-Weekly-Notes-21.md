Car delivery week!

More than getting the car, all my thoughts were on parking (lol). We pasted some edge protectors in our parking gates day before the delivery day.

Took delivery of the car with dad and wife on Wednesday. We were handed over all the required documents and SA explained about everything and asked if there are any questions. One miss was the steering wheel cover which they asked me to request during first service. Overall delivery experience was underwhelming. It felt rushed as they had another car for delivery at the same time. Rode through moderate traffic and reached my parents house.

GFX Trunk Tray

Basic kit costs 10k from Honda which includes pillows, keychains, mats and some ordinary accessory. I thought it wasn't worth the money. Bought GFX premium quality mats and trunk tray. Looks and fits stunningly well. Costed less than 10k too.

Parked at night in our tight parking spot. First time I didn't have to do much work. Parked without a hassle. Even had space for my bike on the side.

Honda key cover and extension I bought from Amazon. looks and fits great.

The wrap around cover after our trip on Sunday since we won't be touching the car for at least 5 days until our long trip.
