Food alert!

Jebi tried something new and made chicken burgers. First try and she nailed it. At this rate I should have a separate category for Jebi's food magic.

Beautiful view of the World Trade Centre in Perungudi.

We went ham on 90s candies this week. Mango bite and Magic pops!

We were tired after a very hectic Friday, so decided to buy food outside. Dragon chicken, Chicken Biryani (65 Combo), Chicken Shawarma Rolls and Chettinand Masala from Copper Kitchen. Food was good and we were starving crazy waiting for the order to arrive that night. 

Lastly, some sad and exciting news. Sad news is that our car is not in good condition. We decided to give it for service at Maruti itself. Expected to get the car after a week or two. Should have done this at the start itself. Anyway, no point thinking about that now.

Good news, me & Jebi decided to take the test drive (long overdue) of the 2/3 Honda cards available in India. 
+ Honda Elevate (Petrol Manual - Top Variant)
+ Honda City 5th Gen (Petrol Manual - Top Variant)

Props to the guy from Capital Honda who followed up on time and scheduled cards at door step. Absolutely awesome service. Whole process took barely 1.5 hrs from initial contact.

Coming to the cars, Elevate felt different as I have never driven an SUV before. Bonnet view is very clear and I can drive with confidence. Felt like I was in a ship when I went over speed breakers. Suspension is trippy. I liked the car but in a weird way.

We also asked the person to park it in our congested parking space and he didn't take 2 minutes to park the car even with side mirrors open. I need more practice lol.

Our sales guy then drove the car back to the showroom and brought Honda City near home. This time, sedan did not feel out of the ordinary. This was more in my comfort zone, steering wheel was buttery smooth and engine was refined. Both the cars share the same engine btw. Someone has to tell the engine is on otherwise you won't notice it. It was like that at least for me.

I had fun driving these cars. Definitely the best part of the week.

Jebi tried something new on Sunday - Garlic Honey Chicken. It was delicious!
