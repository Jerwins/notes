Food alert! Jebi tried something new and made chicken burgers. First try and she nailed it. At this rate I should have a separate category for Jebi's food magic. 


Beautiful view of the World Trade Centre in Perungudi.

We went ham on 90s candies this week. Mango bite and Magic pops!

We were tired after a very hectic Friday, so decided to buy food outside. Dragon chicken, Chicken Biryani (65 Combo), Chicken Shawarma Rolls and Chettinand Masala from Copper Kitchen. Food was good and we were starving crazy waiting for the order to arrive that night. 

Finally, sad and exciting news. Sad news is that our car is not in good condition. We decided to give it for service at Maruti itself. Expected to get the car after a week or two. Should have done this at the start itself. Anyway, no point thinking about that now. 

Good news, we decided to take the test drive (long overdue) of the 2/3 Honda cards available in India. 
+ Honda Elevate (Petrol Manual - Top Variant)
+ Honda City 5th Gen (Petrol Manual - Top Variant)

Props to the guy from Capital Honda who followed up on time and scheduled cards at door step. Absolutely awesome service. 

Coming to the cars, Elevate felt real different as I have never driven an SUV before. Bonnet view is very clear and I can drive with confidence. Felt like I was in a ship when I went over speed breakers. Suspension is trippy. I liked the car in a weird way. We also asked the person to drive it in our congested parking area and he didn't take 2 minutes to park the car (unlike me lol). Guess I need more practice. 

Our sales guy then drove the car back to the showroom and brought Honda City near home. This time, sedan did not feel out of the ordinary. This was more in my comfort zone, steering wheel was buttery smooth and engine is refined. Both the cars share the same engine btw. Someone has to tell the engine is on otherwise you won't notice it. It was like that at least for me. 

Definitely the best part of the week.
