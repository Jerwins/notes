Took Monday off work to do some shopping in T. Nagar. Weather has been alternating between hot and rainy. Overall okayish week hit with depressing rains.

Bought a new helmet from SMK - Stellar Stage on the way back. It's very bulky compared to the old RE half-face helmet but I've gotten used to it. Lovely matte finish, better cushions and safety (ISI and DOT certified). However more weight and vents could have been better. Overall worthy purchase. Initially looked at Axor and MT but this one caught my eye and fit was also very good.

New Toyota Taisor (front rebadge) was on display this week. Toyota and their Suzuki rebadges. Sad Indian presence for the Japanese.

Wife was off to Tuty to help with marriage stuff and to attend another wedding. I decided to stay with mom and dad for the weekend. Having coffee and tea with dad outside is the best part. Good to see Mom is doing better. Ran some errands and came back to my house on Sunday since itâ€™s far from parents house to office. 

My [review](https://www.team-bhp.com/forum/test-drives-initial-ownership-reports/282371-5th-generation-honda-city-v-mt-elegant-edition-review.html) went live on Team-BHP. Check it out if you have time.

Spent most of the days eating at A2B this week and at office.
