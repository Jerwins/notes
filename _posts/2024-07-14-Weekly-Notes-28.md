Wife is off to Tuty to help with marriage stuff. Overall okayish week hit with depressing rains.

Bought a new helmet from SMK - Stellar Stage. It's very bulky compared to the old RE half-face helmet but I've gotten used to it. Lovely matte finish, better cushions and safety (ISI and DOT certified). However more weight and vents could have been better. Overall worthy purchase. Initially looked at Axor and MT but this one caught my eye and fit was also very good.

Replaced halogen bulbs with LED T10s for map and ceiling lights. Overall it was a simple procedure. Everything is detailed nicely in the manual too. So not a problem.
