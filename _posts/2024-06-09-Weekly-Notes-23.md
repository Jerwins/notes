Planned to visit many relatives on Monday. The start couldn't be any worse. Fell sick when I got up in the morning. Drank some Electral and felt okay. Almost cancelled our plans but decided to go ahead.

Just when we thought everything was going well, on the very first turn into main road, a biker with rice bags lost balance upon seeing a police officer and dented our car. I was beyond frustrated and it totally ruined our mood. I called Honda body shop guys and got the quote from them for the dent. Got the money from the guy but later refunded after my wife's advice. Lost my peace of mind over it before the trip.

Started our journey back to Chennai on Wednesday after all the fun and uncontrollable incidents. Reached home before the rains started however we decided to drive through the rain towards the service centre for first service as it crossed 1000 KM (currently at 1655 KM) and also submitted claim for insurance for door replacement which was swiftly approved the next day.

Friday night Punjabi Nation time!

Sister in law was back to Chennai after a long time this weekend. Wife spent some time with her and both went to phoenix mall for shopping. Next day we went to our good friend Sofia-Hari's new house ceremony. We wished them the best. Met some more of wife's office friends and said our hi-byes. We went straight to my parents house since my brother was back from Tirunelveli and will stay here till our mom's birthday. Spent some time with mom and dad and started back to home in bike since our car is still at service centre. SA updated me every day and posted photos before work. I clarified some doubts and he said it'll be ready for pickup after a week.
