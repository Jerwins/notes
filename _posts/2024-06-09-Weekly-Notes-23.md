Planned to visit many relatives on Monday. The start couldn't be any worse. Fell sick when I got up in the morning. Drank some Electral and felt okay. Almost cancelled our plans but decided to go ahead.

Just when we thought everything was going well, on the very first turn into main road, a biker with rice bags lost balance upon seeing a police officer and dented our car. I was beyond frustrated and it totally ruined our mood. I called Honda body shop guys and got the quote from them for the dent. Got the money from the guy but later refunded after my wife's advice. Lost my peace of mind over it before the trip.

Going back to Chennai after all the fun and uncontrollable incidents. Came back before the rains started however we decided to drive through the rain towards the service centre for first service as it crossed 1000 KM (currently at 1655 KM) and also submitted claim for insurance for door replacement which was swiftly approved the next day.
